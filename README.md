# paper2code

Minimal PyTorch implementations of foundational deep learning papers. Each implementation focuses on clarity and educational value while remaining faithful to the original architecture.

## Implementations

| Paper | Directory | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) | [`resnets/`](./resnets) | ResNet-18 for image classification |
| [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) | [`transformers/`](./transformers) | GPT-2 decoder-only transformer |

## Requirements

- PyTorch >= 1.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tiktoken (for transformers)

## Usage

Each implementation includes:
- Well-documented model code with paper references
- Training and evaluation utilities
- README with architecture overview and examples

See individual directories for detailed usage instructions.
